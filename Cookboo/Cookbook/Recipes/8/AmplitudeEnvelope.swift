//: ## Amplitude Envelope
//: A surprising amount of character can be added to a sound by changing its amplitude over time.
//: A very common means of defining the shape of amplitude is to use an ADSR envelope which stands for
//: Attack, Sustain, Decay, Release.
//: * Attack is the amount of time it takes a sound to reach its maximum volume.  An example of a fast attack is a
//:   piano, where as a cello can have a longer attack time.
//: * Decay is the amount of time after which the peak amplitude is reached for a lower amplitude to arrive.
//: * Sustain is not a time, but a percentage of the peak amplitude that will be the the sustained amplitude.
//: * Release is the amount of time after a note is let go for the sound to die away to zero.
